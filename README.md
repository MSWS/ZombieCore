Zombie Apocalypse Core Plugin

For our upcoming Zombie Apocalypse gamemode release, there are some features we'd like that we can't find in native
Minecraft configs or in commercial plugins. Here is a list of features we'd like to see in a custom written Core Plugin
for the Zombie Apocalypse gamemode, in order of priority:

1) Disable Animal Breeding - animals should not be able to breed through conventional means, but we should be able to
   spawn baby animals with commands; disabling feeding might not be the best method (since dogs should eat for health),
   but animals shouldn't go through the breeding process (Deadline: by Friday, 5/28, preferably earlier)

2) Allow Daylight Mob Spawning - might be too easy to get around if zombies aren't present during the daytime, so
   allowing mobs to spawn at either a similar or reduced rate during the daytime would be nice; do note that any hostile
   mob spawns are hijacked by the ZA plugin and will spawn a custom zombie (see plugin here, source code at GitHub links
   at top of page) (Deadline: by Friday, 5/28, preferably earlier)

3) Lower Fishing Chance - in an effort to nerf the amount of food fishing produces, we want to make it harder to get
   fish by using a fishing rod, so being able to reduce fishing chance would be great; would also be cool to have an
   adjustable modifier config/command for this; disabling finding anything other than fish and fairly useless items (
   talk to Tea, list here) will also positively nerf fishing (Deadline: next week, no huge rush)

4) Turn Off Natural Enchanted Items - we want enchanted items to either not exist or be incredibly rare to obtain, so
   zombies with enchanted armor or fancy enchanted fishing items might be problematic; disabling sources of enchanted
   items, while maybe still allowing mobs to wear these items would be great (Deadline: next week, no huge rush)

5) Bypass ZA For Named Skeletons - currently, the ZA plugin hijacks the spawning of all hostile mobs to spawn its own
   custom zombies, but we'd like to have boss mobs, so looking into a way to bypass ZA hijacking named skeletons (
   potential for other mobs in the future) would be awesome; if you're feeling extra super special, since we can't use
   command blocks and we're restricted to 256 characters for commands, having a more robust command for spawning a boss
   mob would also be neat (mob type, health, armor, effects, weapon, etc.) (Deadline: next week, no huge rush)

6) Work With Towny - the Towny plugin has a pretty robust API that you can work with, and we want to incentivize
   objectives for towns, so a good way of doing that is when they reach a goal, we can give them effects or some other
   kind of passive town benefit; nothing set in stone for this, so that's why it's at the bottom, can still talk about
   details if interested and have time (Deadline: none for now, each piece may have their own deadlines)

None of these deadlines are super set in stone, but as a general guide, we're ready to get these things into a dev
server and test 'em out! If anybody's got any questions about any of these things, don't hesitate to hit me up Butters.
List may be edited to have more features in the future.
